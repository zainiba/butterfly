    <h1>Hidden Histories </h1>
    <h2>Spring 2020 </h2>

     <h2 id="disc"> Discovery </h2>
    <h3>Core Emotions to Uncover</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Acceptance - The idea is to accept all the changes that have happened and to accept the type of people we are now.</li>
      <li>Passionate - People can be passionate about places they visit all the time. Our memories of these places are what keep the passion alive.</li>
      <li>Sentimental - Similar to passionate, this feeling arises when memories are associated with a place.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Seek Stories</h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px">A place that comes to mind when I think of San Jose is Alum Rock Park. I remeber spending many summer afternoons at Alum Rock park with my family. Thinking back on the memories I gained in the park brings a warm feeling to my heart, even know whenever I drive past I can't help but to think of my childhood. I remember going to the park in the afternoon — after the sweltering heat of the day passed — and joining games of volleyball and soccer with the other neighbhor kids. It became a routine every summer; go to the park at the same time every afternoon, play sports with the same kids, and head back home before the sunset. Reflecting on these summers now, I have no idea who the kids were but we all became so close during the summer. Our paths crossed and diverged every single summer.</p>

     <h2 id="idea"> Ideation </h2>
     <h3>Human-centric Problem Statements</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>Due to the Corona Virus, national Parks are closed. They do not recommend going to the parks.</li>
       <li>What brought the people to park? What feeling did they yearn for when they connected with other families at the park?</li>
       <li>What happened to those families now that they are older? ..Something about how different paths converged just for a moment of connectedness and community and diverged never to meet again. What brought the families together? Hot summer days, kids are bored, families out wanting to enjoy the day</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Ideate</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>Bring the park indoors</li>
       <li>Butterflies all over the place and slowly gravitate towards different groups then disperse, maybe coming out of the image trigger</li>
       <li>Really wind scene, with picnic blankets, basketballs, soccer balls, flowing past and trees rustling in the wind. Other things you take to the park flying with the wind as well.</li>
       <li>Brightly colored blooms that come out of the ground, but the colors group together and the flowers either separate or die off.</li>
     </ul>

       <li><a href="http://mdorf.com/in-wake-pt-1/">Mark Dorf</a> - He shares what he knows is going to be lost. Makes people aware and appreciative of the present.</li>
